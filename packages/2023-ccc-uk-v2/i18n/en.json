He said he did this because of “the younger generation in Taiwan.”\n\nMirror Media has obtained the exclusive authorization to publish these rare documentary images and his reflection notes on the battlefield. “I want to be the frontline of frontline,” he said. Owing to Chien-Chi Chang, we no longer perceive the war only by the views of western media. We are going to develop our ways of seeing to document the present and history.","pairs":[{"head":"An Outlander in The Strange Land","body":"In May, we talked to Chien-Chi Chang via the internet calls, a Magnum Photos photographer, who was at Zaporizhzhia, a city eight hours away from Kyiv.‘When I was at a restaurant, there’s missile flying from the hill.’ he said. His tone was so calm, as it was just birds flying by. \nUkraine-Russian war began on 24th of February, Chang went to Ukraine on 4th of March, recording funerals, bullet holes, ruins, gunshots, and all of the daily lives in the war zone through camera since then. His lenses always focus on a sense of tranquility, all of the humbleness, fractions, accidents and pain on the field, are covered with his unique and human touch.\n\n"},{"head":"","body":"Chang joined Magnum Photos in 1995 and has been the only Chinese and Taiwanese photographer since then. Magnum Photos was founded in Paris in 1947 by Robert Capa, David \"\"Chim\"\" Seymour, Henri Cartier-Bresson. Magnum refers to a big bottle of wine, the name\"\"Magnum\"\" was chosen because the founding members always drank a bottle of champagne during the first meetings. Magnum Photos is reckoned as the most prestigious organization in the field of documentary photography. Chang’s works not only collected and exhibited by museums around the world, has also won The Academy Award for Best Picture，World Press Photo daily life first prize, and W.Eugene Smith Award.\n\n"},{"head":"","body":"In 1996, Chang moved to New York Chinatown, where he lived with illegal Chinese immigrants in poor apartments for six years in order to uncover their living situation. Series works allowed the Department of Labor to investigate and improve their living standard. Chang’s work“The Chain” shows how an asylum in Kaohsiung uses virtual and physical chains to contain its patients, “Double Happiness” revealed human traffickers arranging marriages between Vietnamese women and Taiwanese men.Chang had also hired by ‘National Geography’ to follow the process of a Korean who escaped all the way from North Korea and fled to Thailand. In 2021, Chang received the Humanities Award from TECO Technology Foundation, for hw ‘putTaiwanese viewpoint on world’s top platform’.\n\n"},{"head":"","body":"Estrangement and connection can be seen in Chang’s work, which may relate to his living status. He lives in Austria and often travels for work, which always makes him feel like a stranger. Pei-Chang Wang, a documentary producer, says most photographers can easily recover from suffering and walk away, but Chang can’t : “He has no interest in emotional attractions. His pictures always come with the feeling of coming home, even if it's in unfamiliar places and nothing exists, they still make you keep thinking about it.”\n\n"},{"head":"","body":"Chang’s friend, San-Tai Hsieh, also a photographer, says: “ I asked Chang to keep safe in war zone, he only replied that he wanted to go East of Ukraine, I asked him to be more careful, he said ‘only want to be the frontline of frontline, maybe I’m crazy.’ His message shows he loves photography more than himself, and also implies that when he sees injustice he would do anything to reveal the cruel truth.”\n\n"},{"head":"","body":"Relationship between Ukraine and Russia is just like Taiwan and China. A photographer who sees himself as a stranger is now in another foreign country recording the war as a Taiwanese, and also opened a window for Taiwanese to see the cruelty of war."}]},"caption":"Chien-Chi Chang.
