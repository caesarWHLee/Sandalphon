The brutal scenes of war once stirred indignation among democratic nations worldwide, with leaders expressing support for Ukraine. Two years have passed, and many Western countries have developed war fatigue, questioning why they should continue funding this war. The voices of ordinary people expressing compassion have also faded, gradually becoming desensitized to the images of war.\n\nChien-Chi Chang has never forgotten Ukraine. In his article, he mentions that while Austrians celebrate the new year with sky-bound fireworks, Ukrainians wake up to the sounds of explosions. Braving the cold, he travels through the snow for the eighth time to the Ukrainian war zone, witnessing the prolonged and arduous conditions on the frontlines, often likened to a \"meat grinder.\" (Note: The original text was written in English. It was translated by Yi-Ling Lo and was proofread by Chien-Chi Chang.)","pairs":[{"head":"","body":"On December 29, 2023, which marked the 674th day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, I found myself aboard an early morning train journeying from the capital, Kyiv, to the western city of Lviv. My anticipation for reuniting with my children in Austria for New Year celebrations was palpable. Shortly after the train's departure, I received a text message from Peter, an editor friend at Interfax (Ukrainian News Services,) inquiring about any potential delays to my travel plans. I said no, but why? This immediately prompted him to convey a grave situation: \"...many enemy projectiles in the air this morning...lots of death and destruction...‚Äù\n\nUpon reflection, I became aware that the persistent, high-pitched air siren alerts reverberated through the corridors of my hotel the previous night. The public address system repeatedly instructed guests to proceed to the designated hotel bomb shelter expeditiously. Subsequent inquiries revealed that Russia had initiated an extensive aerial assault, constituting the most substantial offensive since the commencement of all-out attacks in February 2022. Notably, Ukraine's air defense successfully intercepted a majority of the 122 missiles and 36 Iranian Shahed-type suicide drones targeted at major Ukrainian cities during an 18-hour aerial barrage, as communicated and updated through Telegram news messages.\n\nTragically, the year 2023 drew to a close, mirroring its commencement ‚Äî marked by grievous violence inflicted upon the people of Ukraine. Despite the steady westward progression of my train, it encountered unscheduled halts. Simultaneously, distressing updates persisted through mobile alerts, detailing the dire events such as the destruction of a maternity hospital, schools, and apartment complex.\n\nMeanwhile, I contemplated the feasibility of reaching Lviv on time to catch my scheduled transportation to Krakow Airport. Concurrently, I experienced a sense of unease due to the absence of a combat decompression period (usually seven to 14 days), having transitioned directly from the Donbas frontline to Kyiv and subsequently en route to my home. My mental state remained entrenched in the war zone, with a heightened awareness and wariness of potential drone activity overhead, as well as the ominous threat of incoming rockets and mortars traversing the sky with supersonic speed, rendering them nearly invisible to the human eye, followed by explosive concussions and everlasting deafening humming. But aren't these the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\n\nIn contrast to Ukraine's artillery response, which amounted to only a quarter of Russia's ammunition, a notable factor contributing to this discrepancy is, in part, the reported influx of over 1,000 containers comprising equipment and munitions from North Korea to Russia. This arsenal includes short-range ballistic missiles, anti-tank missiles, mortars, rocket launchers, and shells, as detailed in an Associated Press (AP) news report citing information from the White House on November 14, 2023.\n\nFurthermore, a conspicuous deficit in aid and military support from the United States and the European Union has become evident. The perceived lack of assertiveness from NATO, characterized by a colloquial \"No Action Talk Only\" sentiment, adds to the challenges faced by Ukraine in the ongoing conflict.\n\nThe onset of winter has slowed the war's progression, prompting Ukraine to shift its strategic focus towards defensive fortification efforts, including constructing barb-wired barricades with anti-tank triangular cemented dragon teeth and excavating trenches. One morning, I was embedded with the Fury Brigade, a contingent of former policemen stationed near the frontline town of Kostiantynivka. At this location, I observed the expeditious deployment of AZP S-60 57mm anti-aircraft guns, which, upon activation, generated a formidable cannonade, intensively delivering explosive force straight into Russian positions.\n\nIn conversation with the brigade's press officer, identified by the code name \"Bars,\" it was conveyed that despite the relentless assaults launched by their unit from the land and in the air, resulting in substantial casualties among Russian forces, the adversaries continued to advance. This realization underscored the tragically fitting and brutal appropriateness of the term \"meat grinder\" to describe the protracted and grueling nature of the war.\n\nThe exact troop numbers and casualty figures for both Ukraine and Russia remain undisclosed, shrouded in secrecy. Notwithstanding the absence of official statistics, the rigorous nature of the conflict has been endured by Ukrainian soldiers, volunteers, and conscripts over months of sustained warfare. A growing realization has taken hold within Ukraine, indicating preparedness for an enduring commitment to the conflict. The initial optimism regarding the potential resolution of the war in 2024 is diminishing.\n\nIn response to the prolonged engagement, Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers is drafting a new law on forced military conscription. As of February 12, the draft law has been submitted to Parliament for adoption and approved in the first reading. The measure President Volodymyr Zelensky must sign into law will not be popular. It will likely lower the draft age from 27 to 25 and include women possessing medical or pharmaceutical education. Penalties for evading forced conscription are likely to be included. The new legislation underscores the nation's acknowledgment of the protracted nature of the conflict. Among those impacted by the new law is Serhiy, one of my fixers currently undergoing military training. I have worked with three other fixers, all of whom are married, who may face potential forced conscription this year. \n\nDuring interactions with soldiers from the Fury Brigade near Markivska, I spoke with a 105mm howitzer assistant gunner known by the code name \"Happy,\" whose affable demeanor was reflected in his smiley face. He shared that he had received only three days of training for operating the cannon between firing and loading the howitzer. He acquired additional skills through online resources, mainly on YouTube.\n\nNavigating through the 20-centimeter-deep black, moist, sticky mud proved challenging, especially for someone my age, 63, a cancer survivor. This also posed difficulties for my fixer, Slava, who encountered similar obstacles despite being 30 years younger. However, our movement was swift, avoiding detection by Russia's reconnaissance or suicide drones. In the frontline outposts we visited, unit commanders or press officers consistently provided instructions on where to seek shelter in the event of Russian rocket shelling.\n\nTraversing the filthy and muddy terrain before me, sleek gray mice are scurrying around, a persistent nuisance for soldiers in the dark, damp, 10-square-meter, and two-meter-below-ground sleep quarters for three soldiers. Darkness envelops the tiny space like a heavy shroud in the cramped quarters of the trench. The pale glow of a solitary, flickering LED casts feeble light, revealing an area devoid of life. A pervasive stillness reigns, broken only by the occasional crawling of mice echoing through the desolation. The soldiers, lacking effective countermeasures, relied on weasels to catch mice. Amid continuous incoming and outgoing shelling, akin to the 11 cannon shots of the adorned and abhorred final movement in Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture, the frontline reality brings a stark reminder of the unforgiving environment they navigate daily and the constant uncertainty of life and death, with the next rocket strike unknown in timing and location.\n\nSince 1917, Ukraine has traditionally celebrated Christmas on January 7th, according to the Eastern Orthodox calendar. However, starting in 2023, Ukraine officially shifted its Christmas celebration to December 25th, aligning with the practice of other Western Christians. On this day, a 12-meter artificial Christmas tree on Kyiv's St. Sophia Square is adorned with heart-shaped decorations in the colors of the national flag (blue and yellow). These decorations proudly display the emblem of Ukraine, symbolizing a symbolic distance from Russia for the first time in nearly a century. Since the Russian invasion, Ukraine has undertaken various measures, such as renaming streets and removing monuments, to erase traces of the Russian and Soviet imperial periods.\n\nTwo days before Christmas, I was with the sniper unit of the 425th Assault Battalion Skala near Kindrativska, engaging in conversation with the 38-year-old deputy commander, code sign \"Best,\" renowned as the brigade's top sniper. I asked what he would do Christmas Eve; Best grinned and said, ‚ÄúWe want to fight!‚Äù Inside Best's make-shift office, real-time drone reconnaissance images of a devasted Bakhmut ruined beyond recognition are transmitted on two 43-inch flat-screen TVs. Sharing a video clip of shooting two moving Russian soldiers from distances of 1,770 and 1,820 meters, Best, with a sense of pride, highlighted the complexities involved, including windage, bullet drop, and the impact of the earth's rotation resulting in the objects following complex curved paths, known as the Coriolis Effect. A Russian drone swiftly moved beneath one of the screens, underscoring the ever-present threat.\n\nThe unit's 42-year-old driver, formerly a coal miner, now possessed skills beyond driving, including shooting and flying drones. Every unit member has the same abilities. He prepared traditional red borscht for the fixer and me during the visit. He conveyed that his mother prayed for every soldier daily in the church. As of the current update, their unit remains actively engaged in operations around Bakhmut.\n\nSubsequently, a local Orthodox priest near Kivsharivka blessed senior residents and soldiers in the church, creating an atmosphere of reverence and awe, interrupted only by the shockwave from distant shelling. After the service, the bell resonated, producing a rich, full-bodied tone that echoed through the surroundings.\n\nWhen the train journey was marked by the screeching of tracks and sudden stops, children looked at their parents; passengers sought explanations for the interruption. No air raids or emergency sirens ensued, and no fighter jets were observed flying nearby. False alarm? I don't know, except outside, the winterized landscape unfolded in a barren but cinematic panorama, revealing fields giving way to the horizon, so flat and vast that I could almost sense the earth's curvature on both ends. A few minutes later, the train's whistle pierced the air, announcing the journey continued.\n\nThe passenger next to me, Aleks, a well-traveled agricultural engineer from Kyiv, had a conversation concerning flashpoints in major regional conflicts, including Nagorno-Karabakh, Israel and Hamas, the Korean Peninsula, the South China Sea, and tensions between Taiwan and China. He asked me if Taiwan had learned from the aftermath of the war between Ukraine and Russia and been well-prepared to defend itself. I shrugged and said I certainly hoped so, for I believe a nation's peace and security are only anchored in its strength and ability to preserve and protect its people, land, and sovereignty. Furthermore, let's not forget that Taiwan, though small in size, exudes a charming sweetness combined with a subtle and stealthy strength.\n\nThe need for preparedness among the people of Taiwan in anticipation of potential eventualities is a matter that warrants serious consideration. It is disconcerting to observe former President Ma's interview with Deutsche Welle (DW), during which he suggested that Taiwan should seek to appease China by all available means. Over my 35 years of extensive travel, documenting regions facing precarious situations and encounters with individuals expressing a desire to adopt the perspective, rationalize, or justify the actions of their aggressors has been rare. Such a phenomenon, marked by intricate psychological dynamics and characterized by a denial of abuse, doesn't it align with the concept of Stockholm Syndrome?\n\nDrawing a parallel with Hong Kong serves as a poignant example. My presence in the city on six occasions in 2019 allowed me to cover the unfolding protests by millions of Hong Kongers. However, the subsequent implementation of the draconian national security law (NSL) in early 2020 marked a regrettably transformative shift for Hong Kong ‚Äî from being recognized as a free society, lustrous metropolis, and \"Asia's finest\" to evolving into an Orwellian island city that grapples with an additional layer of governance that casts a shadow over its former radiance.\n\nFortuitously, my train arrived right on schedule in Lviv without any delays. However, upon reaching the border crossing into Poland, the atmosphere shifted to one of anticipation mixed with frustration. A tedious four-hour wait ensued, characterized by the bureaucratic intricacies of the Ukrainian and Polish border procedures. This unforeseen delay led to a missed flight. Disheartened yet determined, I returned home the following day on the first morning flight. The experience, marked by unexpected setbacks, encapsulated the unpredictable nature of travel again.\n\nThe joy of holding my children after returning from war-torn Ukraine is ineffable. Each embrace feels like a precious moment reclaimed from the tumultuous backdrop of conflict. Then, the following evening, close to midnight, Graz metamorphosed into a tableau of celestial celebration as the stroke of midnight marked the transition into the New Year. A night sky erupted into a dazzling display as fireworks ignited, shot, and erupted from every corner, adorning the velvety expanse of the night. Simultaneously, jubilant neighbors engaged in toasts and dance, accompanied by melodies such as \"Celebration\" by Kool & The Gang or \"It's a Beautiful Day\" by Michael Bubl√©.\n\nAs of January 3, marking Day 679 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky reported that Russia had unleashed 500 missiles and drones against Ukraine within just five days. The impact of this aggression extended far beyond the capital. Nationwide, at least 60 lives were lost in this wave of attacks, with cities such as Kharkiv in the northeast, Zaporizhia in the south, Odesa on the southern coast, and even Lviv in the far west all bearing the brunt of the strikes.\n\nMillions of Ukrainians awoke to explosions; that should be a reminder that these echoes should resonate globally. Ukrainian officials have appealed to Western allies for increased air defenses, highlighting the strain on support due to war fatigue. The United Kingdom's steadfast support was noted, with Prime Minister Sunak emphasizing the need to stand with Ukraine for as long as necessary.\n\nPeter, my editor friend at Kyiv-based Interfax-Ukraine news agency, has written articles about the war on the Substack social media platform (\"ukraine@war‚Äù) for the past two years. Since the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, it is about to mark two years until February 24. He emphasizes the cumulative impact of 365 + 365 days, equivalent to 730 days. Moreover, adding another 2922 days marks ten years since Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in February 2014. In other words, Ukraine has endured a total of 3,652 days of bloody conflict and confrontation with the world's second-largest military power. Ukrainian volunteers and soldiers, seasoned by years of combat, continue with unwavering determination and a resilient spirit, enduring further adversity to ensure the survival of their country, lest we forget Ukraine!"}]},"caption":"Photo by Viacheslav Ratynskyi","credit":{"pairs":["Article by: Chien-Chi Chang","Photography by: Chien-Chi Chang","Curation, design and development by:","Wen-Han Lee, Lee-Yu Tseng, Yu-Ju Lee, I-Ching Wang, Hsin-Chan Chien","English Translation: Yi-Ning Lo","English Proofreading: Chien-Chi Chang"]}}}]
